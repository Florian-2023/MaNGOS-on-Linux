# MaNGOS-on-Linux
Here is a Manual to create from scratch a MaNGOS-server running on Linux.
You can run it on any PC, say less than 10 years old, as long as it has 4GB RAM and 15 to 20 GB diskspace
Or in a virtualbox with 1 core or more.
The manual is made in such a way that the server can run without the need for a monitor.
You can put your server in some place away and remotely manage everything.

If you want the whole manual including the restarter-script, get the mangos on linux zip-file.

If you only want the restarter, get the wowadmin zip-file.

If you want to have the website where accounts can be created, get the Bropack from 
https://www.ownedcore.com/forums/world-of-warcraft/world-of-warcraft-emulator-servers/wow-emu-general-releases/613280-elysium-core-1-12-repack-including-mmaps-optional-vendors.html

and also the bropack-mod.

Some other files that can be useful will be put here too.
