# MaNGOS-on-Linux
Here is a Manual to create from scratch a MaNGOS-server running on Linux.

You can use any PC of say, less than 10 years old, as long as it has 4GB RAM and 15 to 20 GB diskspace.

Or in a virtualbox (it can run on 1 core but more is better.)

The manual is made in such a way that the server can run without the need for a monitor.

You can put your server in some place away and remotely manage everything.

If you want the whole manual including the restarter-script, get the mangos on linux zip-file.


If you only want the restarter, get the wowadmin zip-file.


If you want to have the website where accounts can be created, get the Bropack from 

https://www.ownedcore.com/forums/world-of-warcraft/world-of-warcraft-emulator-servers/wow-emu-general-releases/613280-elysium-core-1-12-repack-including-mmaps-optional-vendors.html

and also the bropack-mod.

Some other files that can be useful will be put here too.

info.php, index.php and websiteconfig.php are modded files from the Bropack-website.
Account creation can now be locked, the info-page now shows the area where players are and can do autorefresh.
